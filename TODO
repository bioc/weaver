Fix orphan cache file cleanup

Add a NAMESPACE.  Unfortunately, this appears to be
non-trivial.  Might have to export things we don't
want to export and even then end up with strange
errors.  See the ns branch in git.

More documentation.

More tests.

Allow caching only certain expressions? To avoid large intermediates?

Add option to force recomputation (and recaching) of all chunks.
Perhaps refresh.cache.  Similarly, might be good to be able to turn
off dependency tracking and force use of cache?

Add option to make cache directory document specific.

Verify that all \SweaveOpts{} are supported.  User reported that
pdf.version option didn't work, for example.

For Sweave: multiple graphic formats besides just pdf and eps (perhaps
as a separate driver?)

For Sweave: warn about fig chunks with same name
