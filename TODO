Fix orphan cache file cleanup

Add a NAMESPACE.  Unfortunately, this appears to be
non-trivial.  Might have to export things we don't
want to export and even then end up with strange
errors.  See the ns branch in git.

More documentation.

More tests.

Allow caching only certain expressions? To avoid large intermediates?
